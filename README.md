# DrunkPC
A small prank program.
The mouse will make small twitching movements, while they keyboard will enter random letters.
The mouse's move frequency is far greater than the keyboard's type frequency.

The program is complete in how I intend for it to work, but I still need to find a way to run it in the background of a computer without an open window. As good as this was for practice, I genuinely want to prank a friend... or two.
